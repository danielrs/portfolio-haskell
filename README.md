# Portfolio

Source for my portfolio website, made in Haskell.

## Deployment

The repo includes a Vagrant file, which sets up a debian/wheezy64 machine for compiling the project. This distribution compiles executables compatible with Heroku and RedHat OpenShift services.

## Technologies used

There are a lot of alternatives for building websites (Ruby/RoR, Python/Django, Scala/Play), but since I'm trying to learn Haskell on my free time I decided to made the website using Haskell, and maybe it can help people interested in developing in Haskell too.

### Haskell

Pure functional programming language.

### Yesod

Web develoment framework for Haskell

### Clay

CSS EDSL for Haskell. All the power of Haskell in a CSS Preprocessor.

### Javascript

For the front-end, want to switch to something like Purescript or Haste.
